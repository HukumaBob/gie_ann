# Plan for Developing a Program to Recognize Gastrointestinal Tract Sections Based on Endoscopic Images

## Stage 1: Task Definition and Data Collection

**Task:** Develop a PyTorch-based model for classifying sections of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) from endoscopic images.

**Actions:**
- Collect a dataset of endoscopic images labeled by sections (e.g., esophagus, stomach, duodenum, etc.).
- If data is already available, organize it. If not, create or find accessible medical datasets.

## Stage 2: Model Development on PyTorch

**Actions:**
- Analyze possible neural network architectures suitable for image classification (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
- Implement the model on PyTorch, adding the ability to load images in batches, preprocess (normalize, augment), and classify them.
- Prepare the training process using cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).

## Stage 3: Model Training and Validation

**Actions:**
- Train the model on the training dataset.
- Validate the model on a hold-out set to check its quality.
- Tune optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs, batch size).

## Stage 4: Backend Development on Django

**Actions:**
- Set up a Django project.
- Develop database models (PostgreSQL) to store:
  - Images.
  - Classification results.
  - Metadata (upload date, GIT section type, etc.).
- Implement an API for uploading images and requesting classification results.

## Stage 5: Integration of PyTorch Model with Django

**Actions:**
- Implement a script that automatically sends images from the database for classification by the PyTorch model.
- Return classification results to Django and save them in the database.
- Optimize the process (possibly make it asynchronous via Celery for better performance).

## Stage 6: Testing and Optimization

**Actions:**
- Test the system on real data: how image uploading works, how classification is performed, how results are saved.
- Optimize model performance (e.g., through model compression or GPU utilization).
- Conduct system load testing (if planning to use a large amount of data).

## Stage 7: Final Integration and Deployment

**Actions:**
- Prepare the production environment (deploy on a server, set up the database).
- Ensure system monitoring to track model performance and data accuracy in the database.
